      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments remains a central challenge in robotics, particularly within industrial settings populated by humans, vehicles, and 
        other robots. Traditional navigation pipelines often lack semantic understanding, treating obstacles as simple geometric shapes and failing to adapt effectively to 
        unforeseen scenarios. This work introduces a novel architecture that enhances robotic obstacle avoidance by integrating Foundation Models (FMs) with Behavior Trees 
        (BTs), the standard decision-making framework in ROS2. The proposed pipeline features a Perception Module that extracts semantic information from RGB-D inputs using 
        vision-language models, a Reasoning Module that interprets textual obstacle descriptions via large language models to select context-aware actions, and a BT-based 
        execution system that orchestrates behavior accordingly. Experimental validation using a custom warehouse-like dataset and a range of prompting techniques 
        demonstrates that the inclusion of FMs significantly improves semantic interpretation and decision-making capabilities, without compromising the 
        safety and reliability of traditional methods.

      <h2>Prompts</h2>
      <p>
        In this section, we present the prompts used in our experiments. The prompts are designed to guide the Foundation Model in selecting the 
        appropriate action for the robot based on the detected obstacles. The prompts are structured using the Ollama modelfile format.
        Specifically, SYSTEM identifies the system prompt that sets the context for the model, while MESSAGE user and MESSAGE assistant
        represent the user and assistant messages, respectively, and are used to provide examples of the expected input and output. The 
        prompts are categorized into four types: Zero-shot, In-context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and ICL + CoT. Select the 
        prompt type from the dropdown menu to view the corresponding prompt.

          You are a helpful assistant that helps an autonomous vehicle navigate an industrial environment. The robot is 
          currently navigating towards a goal, when it detects one or more obstacles in front of itself. The robot needs to 
          reach its goal in the shortest time possible. The input is a list of obstacles. Your goal is to choose the correct 
          action the robot should take. The set of possible actions is: SPEAK, AVOID_FAST, AVOID_SLOW, REPORT_EMERGENCY, and 
          WAIT. The SPEAK action makes the robot speak and should be used when the obstacle is a person or a group of people 
          that are walking or standing. The AVOID_FAST action makes the robot navigate around the obstacle at cruising speed 
          and should be used when the obstacle is an inanimate object or a unused vehicle. The AVOID_SLOW action makes the 
          robot navigate around the obstacle at reduced speed and should be used when the obstacle is a person or a group of 
          people that are sitting or operating machinery. The REPORT_EMERGENCY action should be used when the obstacle is an 
          injured person or something that is an hazard. The WAIT action makes the robot wait and should be used only when the 
          obstacle is a human operated vehicle or an autonomous robot. The output must be a JSON file and nothing else. The 
          'answer' field must be a string and can only be SPEAK, AVOID_FAST, AVOID_SLOW, REPORT_EMERGENCY, or WAIT.

      <h2>Behavior Tree</h2>
      This section provides a detailed view of the Behavior Tree (BT) used in our architecture. The BT is designed to manage the robot's actions based on the
      detected obstacles and the selected actions. The BT is structured to ensure that the robot can adapt its behavior dynamically based on the environment and the
      detected obstacles. The BT is implemented in ROS2 and is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new behaviors and actions as needed.

      <h2>Video</h2>
      <p>
        This video demonstrates the execution of the proposed pipeline, with one example for each of the five different actions. It is important to keep in mind that the 
        models are running on an edge device and it communicates with the robot through ROS2. The communication between the robot and the edge device has not been 
        optimized yet, so the latency is not representative of the final performance.
